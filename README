This purpose of this project is to calculate the distance between planets based on information provided by the user. In addition, the project would help the users in getting general information about the planet that they choose (for example: Distance of the planet from the Sun and Earth, number of moons it has, orbital distance, time when the planet is closest to the Earth, etc.). Turtle graphing library is used to simulate planetary motion and matplotlib is used to plot the simulations on a graph. The program is coded in python. Feel free to run it locally :) .
